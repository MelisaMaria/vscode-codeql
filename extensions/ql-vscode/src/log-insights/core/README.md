# log-insights/core

The core of the `log-insights` feature: provides insights from the raw logs emitted by the CodeQL CLI.

This is intended to be a vscode independent directory that in theory can be used in external contexts as well, or become a package of its own one day.
The unit tests for this directory define the interface, and there are no guarantees about external compatibility beyond that.
